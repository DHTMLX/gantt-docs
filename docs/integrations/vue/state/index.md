This section explains how to keep Vue Gantt data consistent with your application state and backend behavior.

## Start Here

Read [Data Binding and State Management Basics](integrations/vue/state/state-management-basics.md) first.

That article explains:

- Vue state/store as source of truth,
- Gantt as source of truth,
- `data.save` and `data.batchSave` callback contracts.

## Pick Your Data Ownership Model

Use **Vue state as source of truth** when:

- your app has surrounding UI that must always reflect latest task/link state,
- you are using a store (Pinia) as authoritative app state.

Use **Gantt as source of truth** when:

- project size and update volume are high,
- the page is primarily chart-centric,
- you want to reduce store churn for frequent chart-side updates.

## Pinia Tutorial

Use [Using Vue Gantt with Pinia](integrations/vue/state/pinia.md) for a practical store-driven implementation.

That tutorial follows the same pattern as the public sample workspace.

## Minimal Starter Pattern

~~~ts
const data = {
  batchSave: changes => ganttStore.applyBatch(changes)
};
~~~

Use this as the entry point for store-driven synchronization when multiple changes can be generated by one chart action.

## Performance Note

If your app handles many changes in one user action (for example auto-scheduling), prefer `data.batchSave` over per-change `data.save`.

Details and callback shape are documented in [Batch Save Contract](integrations/vue/state/state-management-basics.md#databatchsave).
