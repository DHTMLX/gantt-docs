# AI Tools

This section collects materials for using AI with DHTMLX Gantt in two ways:

- **AI-assisted development** - app builders, coding agents, and tool integrations.
- **AI features inside your app** - demos and recommended implementation patterns.

## App builders

If you're using an AI app builder to generate or modify your UI, start here:

- [Lovable AI](./lovable-ai/) — integrate DHTMLX [React Gantt](./../react/) into a Lovable-generated app and improve results using prompts, Knowledge Base, and MCP.

## MCP Server

- [DHTMLX MCP Server](./mcp-server/) — connect an AI tool to up-to-date DHTMLX documentation and API reference.


## AI features inside your app

If you're adding AI capabilities to your application (OpenAI-compatible APIs, assistants, smart suggestions), see:

Demo apps:

- [Gantt Maker AI Demo](https://github.com/DHTMLX/gantt-maker-ai-demo)
- [Gantt Theme Builder AI Demo](https://github.com/DHTMLX/gantt-theme-builder-ai-demo)
