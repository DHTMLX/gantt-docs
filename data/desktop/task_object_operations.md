Getting the Task Object/Id
============================================
To work with data in the Gantt chart, you need to know how to get the object or id of a data item. First of all,
most methods take the data object(id) as a parameter. Secondly, any data-related code scenario can't be implemented without referring to
the data object(id).

*To know about available tree-related methods for tasks, please, refer to the desktop/task_tree_operations.md article.*

Getting the task object
--------------------------
To get a task object, use the api/gantt_gettask.md method:

~~~js
gantt.getTask("t1");
//->{id:"t1", text:"Task #5", start_date:"02-09-2013", duration:28, 
//   progress:0.6, parent:"pr_2", $source:[3,5], $target:[2,1], ...}
~~~

Getting the parent of a task
---------------------------------------
To get the parent of a task, use the api/gantt_getparent.md method or the "**parent**" property of the task's object:

~~~js
gantt.getParent("t1");//->"pr_2". If there is no parent, the method returns the root id
//or
var taskObj = gantt.getTask("t1");//-> {id:"t1", text:"Task #5", parent:"pr_2", ...}
var taskParent = taskObj.parent;  //-> "pr_2"
~~~
*To see all methods related to the tree nature of the Gantt chart, please, read the desktop/task_tree_operations.md article.*

Calculating the task's duration
----------------------------------------
To get the duration of a task, use the api/gantt_calculateduration.md method:

~~~js
gantt.calculateDuration(new Date(2013,03,30),new Date (2013, 04, 02)); // ->16
~~~

Note, if the api/gantt_work_time_config.md option is enabled, the api/gantt_calculateduration.md method calculates the task's duration in working time. 

Calculating the task's end date
----------------------------------------
To get the end date of a task, use the api/gantt_calculateenddate.md method:

~~~js
gantt.calculateEndDate(new Date(2013,03,30),48,"hour"); //-> Tue May 07 2013 17:00:00
~~~

Note, if the api/gantt_work_time_config.md option is enabled, the method considers duration as working time. 


Getting the selected task
-------------------------------------
To get the currently selected task, use the  api/gantt_getselectedid.md method: 

~~~js
gantt.selectTask("t_1"); 
gantt.getSelectedId();                      //-> "t_1" - the id of the selected task
~~~

Getting tasks from the specified time period
------------------------------------------------
To get a collection of tasks that occur during the specified period, use the api/gantt_gettaskbytime.md method:

~~~js
var tasks = gantt.getTaskByTime(new Date(2013,03,05),new Date(2013,03,15)); 
//where tasks is an array of tasks' objects
~~~

Getting all tasks from the Gantt chart
-------------------------------------
To get all tasks presented in the Gantt chart, use the api/gantt_gettaskbytime.md method as in:

~~~js
var tasks = gantt.getTaskByTime();        //returns all tasks as an array of objects
~~~

You can also call the api/gantt_serialize.md method.


Getting the links related to a certain task
------------------------------------------
To get links related to a task, use the **$source**, **$target** properties of the task's object.<br> The properties are autogenerated and store ids of the  related links:

- **$source** - links that comes out from the task.
- **$target** - links that comes into task.

~~~js
var taskObj = gantt.getTask("t1");

var sourceLinks = taskObj.$source;        //-> ["l1","l4"] - ids of coming-out links  /*!*/
var targetLinks = taskObj.$target;       //-> ["l5","l8"] - ids of coming-into links  /*!*/
~~~


Getting the next task starting from the current date
--------------------------
To get the nearest oncoming task, use the api/gantt_gettaskbytime.md method as in:
~~~js
var tasks = gantt.getTaskByTime(new Date(), new Date(9999,1,1);	
//tasks - a list of all oncoming tasks
tasks.sort(function(a,b){ return (a.start_date > b.start_date ? 1 : -1); });
//tasks[0] - the nearest oncoming event
~~~

Getting the task id
--------------------------
Generally, you can get the id of a task from the "data" object of the data set.  

~~~js
{
    data:[
        {id:1, text:"Task #1", start_date:"01-04-2013", duration:18, progress:0.4}, /*!*/
        {id:2, text:"Task #2", start_date:"02-04-2013", duration:8,  progress:0.6}  /*!*/
    ],
    links:[...]
}
~~~

<br>
If you can't get the task's id from the data set, use the api/gantt_gettaskbytime.md method as in:

~~~js
var tasks = gantt.getTaskByTime();                               //returns all tasks
for(var i=0;i<tasks.length; i++){       //goes over all tasks to find the one needed
    if (tasks[i].text == "Task #3") 
        var taskId = tasks[i].id;
};
~~~

*If you know an approximate time when the needed task occurs, you'd better to limit the returned collection of tasks in order to increase the app speed:*

~~~js
var tasks = gantt.getTaskByTime(new Date(2013,05,01),new Date(2013,05,10)); 
for(var i=0;i<tasks.length; i++){  
	if (tasks[i].text == "Task #3") 
    	var taskId = tasks[i].id;
};
~~~

Changing the task id
-------------------------------
To change the current id of a task, use the api/gantt_changetaskid.md method:
~~~js
gantt.changeTaskId("t1", "t11");               //changes the  task id: "t1" -> "t11" 
~~~
