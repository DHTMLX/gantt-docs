dhtmlxGantt with Salesforce 
===============================

This tutorial will give you step-by-step instructions on creating Gantt with [ASP.NET](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/apps/aspnet) and REST API on the server side. 

You can also explore other server-side integration possibilities of Gantt by choosing one of the following tutorials:

- desktop/howtostart_dotnet_core.md
- desktop/howtostart_nodejs.md
- desktop/howtostart_php_laravel.md
- desktop/howtostart_php_slim4.md
- desktop/howtostart_ruby.md

We will make use of the ASP.NET MVC 5 web platform and the Web API 2 controller for REST API to create a Gantt application.
To organize communication with a database we will use the [Entity Framework](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/entity-framework).
We will build our application with the help of the Visual Studio IDE.
