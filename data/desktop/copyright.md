Third Party Licenses
=====================================

This article contains Third Party Software Notices and/or Additional Terms and Conditions for licensed third party software components included within the DHTMLX Gantt library.

A compiled library **Bluebird** comes under the MIT license and is used in the JS files of our Gantt chart; we've included it in the notes of the code inside the JS file. Here is how it's applied in Gantt: api/gantt_promise.md. 

**Roboto Google font** used in our Material skin is not included in the library by default. But it is usually added manually as described in our documentation.

Additionally, we use some open source libraries such as **Node.js Express module, body_parser and strip_tags**  in our samples (they can be found in the samples package, backend/package.json). However, they are not part of the Gantt library and are only used for demonstration purposes.
