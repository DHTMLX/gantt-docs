Undo Extension
=================

The *Undo* object has a set of methods that allow you to undo/redo the made changes. <br>
Read details about the Undo extension in the desktop/undo_redo.md article.

Methods
----------

The following methods are available via the **gantt.ext.undo** object:

###Undo() / Redo() 

- <span class=submethod>**undo (): void**</span> - reverts the changes made in the gantt

~~~js
gantt.ext.undo.undo();
~~~

- <span class=submethod>**redo (): void**</span> - applies the reverted changes to the gantt once again

~~~js
gantt.ext.undo.redo();
~~~

###getUndoStack() / getRedoStack() 

- <span class=submethod>**getUndoStack (): UndoRedoAction[]**</span> - returns the stack of stored undo user actions

~~~js
var stack = gantt.ext.undo.getUndoStack();
~~~

- <span class=submethod>**getRedoStack (): UndoRedoAction[]**</span> - returns the stack of stored redo user actions

~~~js
var stack = gantt.ext.undo.getRedoStack();
~~~

The returned stack is an array of the undo user actions. Each user action contains a set of commands. A command is an object with the following attributes:
 
- **_type_** - (*string*) the type of a command: "add/remove/update"
- **_entity_** - (*string*) the type of the object which was changed: "task" or "link"
- **_value_** - (*object*) the changed task/link object 
- **_oldValue_** - (*object*) the task/link object before changes

###clearUndoStack() / clearRedoStack()

- <span class=submethod>**clearUndoStack (): void**</span> - clears the stack of stored undo commands

~~~js
gantt.ext.undo.clearUndoStack();
~~~

- <span class=submethod>**clearRedoStack (): void**</span> - clears the stack of stored redo commands

~~~js
gantt.ext.undo.clearRedoStack();
~~~

###saveState()

- <span class=submethod>**saveState (id, entityType): boolean**</span> - saves the current state of a task/link before the changes are made
	- **_id_** - (*string | number*) - the id of a task/link,
	- **_type_** - (*string*) - the type of an entry for which the id is provided as the first argument. <br>Supported values: "task", "link". 

~~~js
gantt.ext.undo.saveState(1, "task");
gantt.ext.undo.saveState(1, "link");
~~~
