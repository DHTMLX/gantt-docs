Interface of Gantt Chart
====================
A Gantt chart is one of the most popular ways to show the activities occurred over a time period. 

- Each activity in the chart is displayed as a bar.
- The X-Axis of the chart is a time scale.
- The Y-Axis of the chart is a grid with the names of activities and other activity-related information. The first column of the
grid is a tree that presents the hierarchy of the tasks. You can close, open a branch by clicking on the '+'/'-' icon near the title. Note, the Gantt chart displays only the tasks opened in the tree.
